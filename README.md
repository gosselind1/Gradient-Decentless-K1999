# Gradient-Decentless-K1999
This repository contains an example of some of the algorithmic type work I can accomplish.

Specifically, this repository contains a jupyter notebook file which contains some code for a Gradient-Decentless K1999 implementation, some example usage, and a toy modification to improve corner rounding.

I wrote this up over the course of a evening (with some bug fixes over the next few days) after seeing the rather poor performance of some of the implementations of K1999 out there that utilize gradient-descent. I am unsure if this would still be quicker in a proper performant language instead of python, but compared to the python implementation that this implementation was being compared to it was signficantly faster.

This was written up for a group project for CSE-5820 during the Spring 2023 semester at UCONN during my master's.
